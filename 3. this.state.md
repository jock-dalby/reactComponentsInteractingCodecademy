Dynamic information is information that can change.

React components will often need dynamic information in order to render. For example, a component displaying a game's score will need to check the score before it can display it.

There are two ways for a component to get dynamic information: props and state. Besides props and state, everything in a component should always stay exactly the same.

It's time to learn about state. props and state are all that you need to set up an ecosystem of interacting React components.

----- getInitialState -----

A React component can access dynamic information in two ways: props and state.

Unlike props, a component's state is not passed in from the outside. A component decides its own state.

To make a component have state, write a getInitialState function:
```js
var Example = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function () {
    return { mood: 'decent' };
  },

  render: function () {
    return <div></div>;
  }
});

<Example />
```
getInitialState should return an object, like in the example above.

Look at the bottom of the above code. <Example /> has a state of { mood: 'decent' }.

----- Access a Component's state -----

To read a component's state, use the expression this.state.name-of-property:
```js
var TodayImFeeling = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function () {
    return { mood: 'decent' };
  },

  render: function(){
    return (
      <h1>
        I am feeling {this.state.mood}!
      </h1>
    );
  }
});
```
The above component class reads a property in its state from inside of its render function.

Just like this.props, you can use this.state from any property on the instructions object.

----- Update state with this.setState -----

A component can do more than just read its own state. A component can also change its own state.

A component changes its state by calling the function this.setState.

this.setState takes two arguments: an object that will update the component's state, and a callback. You basically never need the callback.

```js
var Example = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function () {
    return {
      mood:   'great',
      hungry: false
    };
  },

  render: function () {
    return <div></div>;
  }
});

<Example />
```
Notice that <Example /> has a state of:
```js
{
  mood:   'great',
  hungry: false
}
```
Now, let's say that <Example /> were to call:
```js
this.setState({ hungry: true });
```
After that call, here is what <Example />'s state would be:
```js
{
  mood:   'great',
  hungry: true
}
```
The mood part of the state remains unaffected!

this.setState takes an object, and merges that object with the component's current state. If there are properties in the current state that aren't part of that object, then those properties remain how they were.

----- Call this.setState -----

The most common way to call this.setState is to call a custom function that wraps a this.setState call. makeSomeFog is an example:
```js
var Example = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function () {
    return { weather: 'sunny' };
  },

  makeSomeFog: function () {
    this.setState({
      weather: 'foggy'
    });
  }
});
```
