A React application can contain dozens, or even hundreds, of components.

Each component might be small and relatively unremarkable on its own. When combined, however, they can form enormous, fantastically complex ecosystems of information.

In other words, React apps are made out of components, but what makes React special isn't components themselves. What makes React special is the ways in which components interact.

----- A Component in a Render Function -----

Here is a render function that returns an HTML-like JSX element:
```js
var Example = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
});
```

Render functions can also return another kind of JSX: component instances.
```js
var OMG = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return <h1>Whooaa!</h1>;
  }
});

var Crazy = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return <OMG />;
  }
});
```
In the above example, Crazy's render function returns an instance of the OMG component class.

When a component renders another component, what happens is very similar to what happens when ReactDOM.render renders a component.

----- Require a file -----

If you want to use a variable that's declared in a different file, such as NavBar, then you have to import the file that you want. To import a file, you can use require and pass in a filepath:

```js
var NavBar = require('./NavBar');
```

----- module.exports -----

You just want to the NavBar component class, so that you can render a <NavBar /> instance.

What you need is a way to import only a specific part of a file into another file.

The answer is something called module.exports. module.exports comes from Node.js's module system, just like require does. module.exports and require are meant to be used together, and you basically never see one without the other.

Here's how you use module.exports:

In one file, declare module.exports to be equal to an expression. It could be any expression you want:
```js
// Manifestos.js:

var faveManifestos = {
  futurist: 'http://bit.ly/1lKuB2I',
  SCUM:     'http://bit.ly/1xWjvYc',
  cyborg:   'http://bit.ly/16sbeoI'
};

module.exports = faveManifestos;
```
In a different file, use require to import the first file. require won't return the entire first file; it will return the first file's module.exports value!
```js
// App.js:

// Link to the Futurist Manifesto:

console.log(require('./Manifestos').futurist);
```
module.exports means, "If you require the file that I am in, then here's what you're going to get!"
