Information that gets passed from one component to another is known as "props."

Every component has something called props.

A component's props is an object. It holds information about that component.

To see a component's props object, you use the expression this.props. Here's an example of this.props being used inside of a render function:
```js
render: function () {

  console.log("Props object comin' up!");

  console.log(this.props);

  console.log("That was my props object!");

  return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
}
```
Most of the information in this.props is pretty useless! But some of it is extremely important.

----- Pass 'props' to a Component -----

You can pass information to a React component.

How? By giving that component an attribute:
```js
<MyComponent foo="bar" />
```
Let's say that you want to pass a component the message, "This is some top secret info.". Here's how you could do it:
```js
<Example message="This is some top secret info." />
```
As you can see, to pass information to a component, you need a name for the information that you want to pass.

In the above example, we used the name message. You can use any name you want.

If you want to pass information that isn't a string, then wrap that information in curly braces. Here's how you would pass an array:
```js
<Greeting myInfo={["top", "secret", "lol"]} />
```
In this next example, we pass several pieces of information to <Greeting />. The values that aren't strings are wrapped in curly braces:
```js
<Greeting name="Frarthur" town="Flundon" age={2} haunted={false} />
```

----- Render a Component's 'props' -----

You will often want a component to display the information that you pass.

Here's how to make a component display passed-in information:

1 - Find the component class that is going to receive that information.
2 - Include this.props.name-of-information in that component class's render function's return statement.

```js
var React = require('react');
var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');

var Greeting = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return <h1>Hi there, {this.props.firstName}!</h1>;
  }
});

// ReactDOM.render goes here:
ReactDOM.render(
  <Greeting firstName='Jock' />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

----- Pass 'props' from Component to Component -----

The most common use of props is to pass information to a component, from a different component.

<strong>A curmudgeonly clarification about grammar:</strong>
You may have noticed some loose usage of the words prop and props. Unfortunately this is pretty inevitable.

props is the name of the object that stores passed-in information. this.props refers to that storage object. At the same time, each piece of passed-in information is also called a prop. props could refer to two pieces of passed-in information, or it could refer to the object that stores those pieces of information. :(

----- Render different UI based on 'props' -----

You can do more with props than just display them. You can also use props to make decisions.

----- Put an Event Handler in a Component Class -----

You can, and often will, pass functions as props. It is especially common to pass event handler functions.

However, you have to define an event handler before you can pass one anywhere. So how do you define an event handler in React?

You define an event handler as a property on the instructions object, just like the render function. Almost all functions that you define in React will be defined in this way, as instructions object properties.

```js
var React = require('react');

var Example = React.createClass({

  handleEvent: function () {
    alert('I am an event handler.'
    + '  If you see this message,'
    + ' then I have been called.');
  },

  render: function () {
    return (
      <h1 onClick={this.handleEvent}>
        Hello world
      </h1>
    );
  }
});
```
Here an event handler function is defined, and is then attached to an event.

----- handleEvent, on Event, and this.props.onEvent -----

When you pass an event handler as a prop, there are two names that you have to choose.

Both naming choices occur in the parent component class - that is, in the component class that defines the event handler and passes it.

The first name that you have to choose is the name of the event handler itself.

The second name that you have to choose is the name of the prop that you will use to pass the event handler. This is the same thing as your attribute name.

These two names can be whatever you want. However, there is a naming convention that they often follow. You don't have to follow this convention but you should understand it when you see it.

Here's how the naming convention works: first, think about what type of event you are listening for. In our example, the event type was "click."

If you are listening for a "click" event, then you name your event handler handleClick. If you are listening for a "keyPress" event, then you name your event handler handleKeyPress:
```js
React.createClass({
  handleHover: function () {
    alert('I am an event handler.');
    alert('I will be called in response to "hover" events.');
  }
});
```
Your prop name should be the word on, plus your event type. If you are listening for a "click" event, then you name your prop onClick. If you are listening for a "keyPress" event, then you name your prop onKeyPress:
```js
React.createClass({
  handleHover: function () {
    alert('I am an event handler.');
    alert('I will listen for a "hover" event.');
  },

  render: function () {
    return <Child onHover={this.handleHover} />;
  }
});
```

One major source of confusion is that the name onClick has special meaning, but only when it's used on HTML-like elements.

Look at d)Button.js. When you give a <button></button> an attribute named onClick, then the name onClick has special meaning. As you've learned, this special onClick attribute creates an event listener, listening for clicks on the <button></button>:
```js
// Button.js

// The attribute name onClick
// creates an event listner:
<button onClick={this.props.onClick}>
  Click me!
</button>
```
Now look at d)Talker.js. Here, when you give <Button /> an attribute named onClick, then the name onClick doesn't do anything special. The name onClick does not create an event listener when used on <Button /> - it's just an arbitrary attribute name:
```js
// Talker.js

// The attribute name onClick
// is just a normal attribute name:
<Button onClick={this.handleClick} />
```
The reason for this is that in <Button /> is not an HTML-like JSX element; it's a component instance.

Names like onClick only create event listeners if they're used on HTML-like JSX elements. Otherwise, they're just ordinary prop names.

----- this.props.children -----

Every component's props object has a property named children.

this.props.children will return everything in between a component's opening and closing JSX tags.

So far, all of the components that you've seen have been self-closing tags, such as <MyComponentClass />. They don't have to be! You could write <MyComponentClass></MyComponentClass>, and it would still work.

this.props.children would return everything in between <MyComponentClass> and </MyComponentClass>.

```js
// Example 1
<BigButton>
  I am a child of BigButton.
</BigButton>


// Example 2
<BigButton>
  <LilButton />
</BigButton>


// Example 3
<BigButton />
```
In Example 1, <BigButton>'s this.props.children would equal the text, "I am a child of BigButton."

In Example 2, <BigButton>'s this.props.children would equal a <LilButton /> component.

In Example 3, <BigButton>'s this.props.children would equal undefined.

If a component has more than one child between its JSX tags, then this.props.children will return those children in an array. However, if a component has only one child, then this.props.children will return the single child, not wrapped in an array.


Refer to e) => Each <List><List /> instance is passed a singular title: "Living Musician" and "Living Cat Musician," respectively. Somehow, each <List><List /> counts its list-items and automatically adds an "s" to the end of its title if the count is greater than one. We could add a second piano cat, and the second list title would automatically pluralize.

----- getDefaultProps -----

Components expect to receive props but what if nobody passes any?

For example, if nobody passes any text to Button, then Button's display will be blank. It would be better if Button could display a default message instead.

You can make this happen by writing a function named getDefaultProps:
```js
var Example = React.createClass({

  getDefaultProps: function () {},

  render: function () {
    return <h1>{this.props.text}</h1>;
  }
});
```
The getDefaultProps function should return an object:
```js
var Example = React.createClass({

  getDefaultProps: function () {
    // Return an object:
    return {};
  },

  render: function () {
    return <h1>{this.props.text}</h1>;
  }
});
```
Inside of this returned object, write properties for any default props that you'd like to set:
```js
var Example = React.createClass({
  getDefaultProps: function () {
    return { text: 'yo' };
  },

  render: function () {
    return <h1>{this.props.text}</h1>;
  }
});
```
If an <Example /> doesn't get passed any text, then it will display "yo."

If an <Example /> does get passed some text, then it will display that passed-in text.
